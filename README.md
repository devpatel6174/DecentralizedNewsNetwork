# Decentralized News Network

Spearheading democratized media using the blockchain

## Main Features

 1. **Untraceable Testimony**
	 A witness, unless they wish so, cannot be identified through their testimony.
	 
2. **Locally Encrypted Blocks**
		Blockchain copies do not reveal underlying media content in an effort to thwart targeted attacks on certain media pieces.

3. **Load Balancing and Fraud Detection**
      Upload restrictions to the blockchain may have to be enforced until an alternative is found. This is to prevent DoS-style attacks where crucial and urgent media is pushed out of view by an influx of trivial media. (e.g. covering up war crimes with cat memes)

4. **Anarchic Governance**
    In the initial rendition, there is no DAO. My belief is that actors that wish to crush democratized media have the resources to launch a 51% attack or otherwise garner control of a DAO with relative ease. The blockchain will be managed by an autonomous algorithm.

There are many problems that may appear to plague any potential rendition of the Decentralized News Network. Quite simply because actors that oppose this are extremely resourceful and motivated. These will have to be progressively resolved as new and unexpected problems appear.
